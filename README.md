**INTRODUCTION:**

Kaizo is a modified set of game rules for playing a randomized version of Pokemon FireRed.

Inspired by a number of Twitter posts and Twitch clips of unlikely battles in a Kaizo run, the goal of this project is to develop a framework for simulating such encounters in the game. Statistical analyses will be performed to find optimal strategies in the game, or, at the least, discover the odds of winning certain battles. Eventualy, the goal is to develop a model which can play the game by itself.
